/*The JavaScript Switch Statement
Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed. 

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

########### The break Keyword ##########

When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution inside the switch block.

It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.

Note: If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case.


        
// switch (key) {
//     case value:
        
//         break;

//     default:
//         break;
// }

const month = "march"

switch (month) {
    case "jan":
        console.log("January");
        break;
    case "feb":
        console.log("feb");
        break;
    case "march":
        console.log("march");
        break;
    case "april":
        console.log("april");
        break;

    default:
        console.log("default case match");
        break;
}
